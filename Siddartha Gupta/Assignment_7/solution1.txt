Q) What is the size of the UDP header ? What are the different fields? Describe its fields.


  The UDP header is of 8 bytes. 
  There are 4 different fields each of the fields is of 2 bytes. 
  Different fields of UDP header : 

  a) Source Port Number 
     This field identifies the sender's port, when used, and should be assumed to be the port to reply to 
	 if needed. If not used, it should be zero. If the source host is the client, the port number is likely
	 to be an ephemeral port. If the source port host is a server , the port number is likely to be a well-
	 known port number from 0 to 1023. 

  b) Destination Port Number 
     This field identifies the receiver's port and is required milar to source port number, if the client is
	 the destination host then the port number will likely be an ephemeral port number and if the destination
	 host is the server then the port number will likely be a well-known port number.

  c) Length 
     This field specifies the length in bytes of the UDP header and UDP data.The minimum length is 8 bytes, 
	 the length of the header.The field size sets a theoretical limit of 65,535 bytes (8-byte header +
	 65,527 bytes of data) for a UDP datagram.However, the actual limit for the data length, which is imposed
	 by the underlying IPv4 protocol, is 65,507 bytes (65,535 bytes − 8-byte UDP header − 20-byte IP header).
    
  d) Checksum 
     The checksum field may be used for error-checking of the header and data. This field is optional in IPv4,
	 and mandatory in most cases in IPv6. The field carries all-zeros if unused.It provides a way to detect
	 errors in the header and payload.
