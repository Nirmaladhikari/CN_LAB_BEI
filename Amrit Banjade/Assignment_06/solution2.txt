# This is the solution of the question no.2 of the task.md of the Assignment_06 . 

# The answer in this particular file solution2.txt based on the packet with Frame:45 of file ipv6.pcapng and
  the screenshot is also given as ipv6ss.png. 

Headers and their values : 
 1) Version (4 bits) : 
    Has the value 0x6 which can also be seen as 6 on the first 4 byte of highlighted text down , which has the 
	meaning that we are using the ipv6. 
 
 2) Traffic Class (6+2 bits) :
    Has the value 0x00 which has the meaning that the package is of normal type and no special Quality of 
	Service is requested , which is given by first 6 bits and last 2 bits gives that no explicit 
	congestion is requested. 

 3) Flow label (20 bits): 
    Has the value 0x00500 ,this value can be used by the source to indicate that the packets with this flow
	label belong to the same flow, allowing routers and switches in the network to identify and possibly
	provide special handling for this flow. The exact handling depends on the policies and capabilities of
	the network devices. 

 4) Payload Length (16 bits): 
    Has the value 0x0047 , it indicates that the payload of the IPv6 packet, which includes any extension
	headers and the transport layer data, is 71 bytes long.
	Hence the size of the whole packet would be: 40 + 71 =111 bytes since 40 bytes ipv6 header is fixed.
	We can confirm that by clicking on the each layer from Network layer to Application layer i.e 
	Network,Trasport and Application layer. Network layer is of 40 bytes, Transport layer is of 32 and 
	Application layer is of 39 bytes(TLS in this case ). 

 5) Next header(8 bits):
    Has the value 0x06 , it indicates that the next header is a TCP header . It can have different value such 
	as 0x11 for UDP header, 0x3A for ICMPv6 etc. 

 6) Hop limit(8 bits): 
    Has the value 0x40 , it means  packet is allowed to be forwarded by up to 64 routers. Each time a router
	forwards the packet, it decreases the Hop Limit by one.When the Hop Limit reaches zero, the packet is
	discarded to prevent it from looping indefinitely in the network.
 
 7) Source Address (128 bits):
    Has the value 2400:1a00:b1e0:3f34:58d6:43c8:8876:d8f7, which means the packet is coming from that address. 

 8) Destination Address(128 bits): 
    Has the value 2404:6800:4002:826::200a, which means the packet is coming into this address.
