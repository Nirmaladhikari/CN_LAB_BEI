#different header value and why is that.........??


 1) Version (4 bits) : 
    Has the value 0x6 which can also be seen as 6 on the first 4 byte of highlighted text down , which has the 
	meaning that we are using the ipv6. 

 2) Traffic Class (8 bits) :
    Has the value 0x00 which has the meaning that the package is of normal type and no special Quality of 
	Service is requested , which is given by first 6 bits and last 2 bits gives that no explicit 
	congestion is requested.

 3) Flow label (20 bits): 
    The value 0x00000 suggests that the source node does not require any special handling for these packets. 
    It means the packets should be treated with the default processing by routers and switches.Setting the Flow
    Label to 0x00000 indicates that the packet is not part of any special flow and should be treated using default 
    forwarding and handling rules by routers and other network devices. This is the standard setting for most general
     internet traffic where no special requirements are specified.

 4) Payload Length (16 bits): 
    It has the value of 0x0020, indicate that the Payload Length field is set to 32, which means the packetâ€™s payload
    (the data part of the packet after the IPv6 header) is 32 bytes long. This does not include the IPv6 header itself, 
    which is 40 bytes, so the total size of the packet is 72 bytes (40 bytes of header + 32 bytes of payload).

 5) Next header(8 bits):
    It has the value 0x3a, which indicates that the header following the IPv6 header is an ICMPv6 header. It can have different value such 
	as 0x11 for UDP header, 0x06 for TCP etc. 

 6) Hop limit(8 bits): 
    Hop Limit field in an IPv6 header is set to 0xFF (or 255 in decimal), it indicates that the packet can 
    traverse up to 255 hops before being discarded by a router.

 7) Source Address (128 bits):
    Has the value fe80:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001, which means the packet is coming from that address. 
 
 8) Destination Address (128 bits):
    Has the value fe80:0000:766c:206b:4aa4:4bb8, which means the packet is coming into this address.
